Apache Bash Downloader

Just a simple scripts to download stuff from Apache.  I couldn't find a utility
to programmatically download binaries and do the following:

1. Use the closer.cgi to find a mirror so I wasn't pinging one server all the time

2. Parse the signatures and verify the download, because the md5 file contains multiple entries

The download_* script will download the package named in the script.  Each
script has a default version, but can override that with an environment
variable.  For example, running

./download_hadoop.sh

will download version 2.6.4 by default.  If you wanted to override it, run
something like

VERSION=2.6.1 ./download_hadoop.sh

All the download_* scripts source some common functions, defined in common.sh.
Check out the source for more information about what is going on.

Since these scripts download from the mirrors, it is possible that older
versions of a package are no longer hosted.  For example, on 22 June 2016,
most mirrors do not have hadoop prior to 2.5.2.  Some mirrors are better than
others in terms of speed.  Some mirrors fail sometimes too.

If you don't see the project you want to download, feel free to create a
ticket.  Or if you want it faster, feel free to make a pull request.

It really should be easier than this :(  Maybe there is a better way.
