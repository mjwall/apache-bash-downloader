Hadoop Downloader

Just a simple script to download Hadoop.  I have been unable to
programmatically download and do the following:

1. Uses the closer.cgi to find a mirror which spreads the load of downloading

2. Parse the signatures and verifies the download

This bash script does both.  It really should be easier than this :(
