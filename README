Hadoop Downloader

Just a simple script to download Hadoop.  I have been unable to
programmatically download and do the following:

1. Use the closer.cgi to find a mirror so I wasn't pinging one server all the time

2. Parse the signatures and verify the download, because the md5 file contains multiple entries

This bash script does both.  It really should be easier than this :(  Maybe there is a better way.
